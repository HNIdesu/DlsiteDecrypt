# DlsiteDecrypt

## Introduction
This program is designed to decrypt `.dlst` files and convert them into regular files. It is based on the [llc1123/dlsite-key-dumper](https://github.com/llc1123/dlsite-key-dumper), but the original repository is no longer maintained. The project is currently under development.

## Dependencies
To run the project, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

- `pycryptodome` - A library for cryptographic operations.
- `psutil` - A library for retrieving information on running processes and system utilization.
- `kaitaistruct` - A library for working with Kaitai Struct files.

## TODO
- [ ] Adapt to support [DLsite Viewer v1.1.9.0](https://mega.nz/file/YYBFCKhJ#HcG05K_s_Ujd4aNY3UpX5_17rxbNLehrAnOOrgUER7A)

## Credits
- [llc1123/dlsite-key-dumper](https://github.com/llc1123/dlsite-key-dumper) for the original implementation
